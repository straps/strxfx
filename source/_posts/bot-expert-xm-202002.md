I'm giving away the possibility to receive a **free**, custom coded, Expert Advisor for Metatrader 4 (MT4).


#### Rules:
 - Open a new XM account clicking on the following banner or on [this link](http://bit.ly/xm-acc-reg)
 - Deposit at least 250$ or 250â‚¬

</a>


#### How it will work ?

The EA will work on every pair and timeframe you want, and with XM, you could use it even on many **Stocks**.

The only condition is that it will be linked to the newly opened account, you will not be able to run it on any other account number, but it will be 100% your for how many instances and for how much time you desire.

Do you have a trading idea? Do you want to automate your trading strategy? Do you like grids? Do you want to buy low and sell high based on an indicator of your choice?

Contact me via Telegram ([@fstraps](https://t.me/fstraps)) or [email](mailto:fstraps@gmail.com), describe me your needs and I will tell you if feasible and, step by step, how to proceed


#### How is it possible ?

Every broker charges you a small fee for every trade, via spread or commissions; registering with [my link](http://bit.ly/xm-acc-reg), a small part of that commission will be credited to me, it costs nothing to you and let me do what I'm doing


#### Conditions apply

 - The EA will be linked to the newly opened account, you will not be able to run it on any other account number and/or broker account
 - I will not be responsible for eventual losses caused by the EA, the logic inside it belongs to you and you decide how and when to use it
 - EA will work for 1 year; it will be unlocked forever after trading 5 lots of any symbol
 - EA feasibility will be evaluated before starting working on it, contact [me](mailto:fstraps@gmail.com) before proceeding
