Nike {% finviz $NKE %} is ... really Nike doesn't need an intro....

![NKE on Finviz](https://finviz.com/publish/070919/NKEc1dl1523.png)

Price is ranging from 80 to 90 $ since Feb and it is been rejected many times near the 90$ resistance

Today's long upper shadow could push the price below 85$ again for a first target at 82.5 and the second at 80$

Sold 2 AMD contracts with a 140% gain, AMD was very good trade...and is still a valid setup in my opinion documented [here](/2019/06/24/options-trading-day-1/)
