*This post is part of the [Options Trading Experiment](/2019/06/23/options-trading-day-0)*

AT&T {% finviz $T %} is one of the oldest and biggest american telecommunications company

Trend is bullish but price is facing 2 good resistances, one at 33$ where price has been rejected many times and the other at 34$

My long term vision is bullish for sure, but short/mid term is bearish, a retracement till 31$ or, in the "best" case, to 29$ will be not so strange

Anyway, with 5G behind the corner I will not risk more than 1% for this trade
