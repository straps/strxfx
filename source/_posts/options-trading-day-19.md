#### Portfolio adjustments

**Important update:** I will not make portfolio adjustments on winning trades anymore

Selling in-profit contracts does exactly the oppsite of what I'm trying to learn with this experiment: cut losses and let profits run

I will sell my positions only 1 week before contracts expiration in order to not have ITM stocks assigned
