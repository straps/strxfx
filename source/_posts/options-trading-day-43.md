*This post is part of the [Options Trading Experiment](/2019/06/23/options-trading-day-0)*

Visa Inc. {% finviz $V %} operates as a payments technology company worldwide

Despite today's trade war tensions, I decided to buy a call because Visa is really a solid company and is approaching a very good support at 165$

I opted for the October expiration to give the market time to forget trade tensions and rise again

#### Portfolio adjustments

I'm fighting with the weak part of me trying not to sell my {% finviz $NKE %} options at a very good 350% gain

It is very hard even with a demo account, but this is part of the experiment and I want to respect my decisions and go all the way down
