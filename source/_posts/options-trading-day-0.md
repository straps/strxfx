I want to share my personal options trading strategy before starting trading with real money

I will trade using a Tradestation simulated account with an initial balance of 100.000$

My strategy is mostly based on price action, with a constant outlook to fundamental news

This is my account as of today ![Day 0 account status](/media/strx-20190623-002.png "Day 0 account status")

From tomorrow to the end of the year I will publish my orders, positions and balance day by day motivating every trade I make

I will risk a maximum of 2% per trade based on how I feel about the trade
