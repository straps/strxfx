I want to share my personal options trading strategy before starting trading with real money

I will trade using a Tradestation simulated account with an initial balance of 100,000$

My strategy is mostly based on price action, with a constant outlook to fundamental news

This is my account as of today ![Day 0 account status](/media/strx-20190623-002.png "Day 0 account status")

From tomorrow to the end of the year I will publish my orders, positions and balance day by day motivating and trying to explain every trade I make

### Rules to enter trades

- risk a maximum of 2% per trade based on how I feel about the trade
- trade with the main trend; trade against it only on strong reversal signals
- try to balance CALLs and PUTs on a per-sector basis

### Rules to exit trades

- options are always sold before their expiration
- options are never sold before the expiration week, except in case of big gains (>100%) when I could decide to sell some or all the contracts
